Thanks to amazing [criterion author](https://github.com/bheisler) for his raytraycing project!

It turned out to be hell of a mutch bigger deal I initially thought it would.
Consider this a version update.

This stuff is hard for me personally without any background in rendering and
basic understanding of linear transformations.
Also some parts are different two years later, so I am not able to blindly re-type all of the code anyway.
And this is great experience! <3

1. Simple sphere
2. Spheres on a plane
3. Basic shadows
4. Texturing: using vector products to calculate texture
5. Reflections: basic implementation with recursive restriction.
