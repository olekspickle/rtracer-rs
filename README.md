## ray tracer in rust

Thanks to amazing [criterion author](https://github.com/bheisler) for his project!
This stuff is hard for me personally without any background in rendering and
basic understanding of linear transformations.
Also some parts are different two years later, so I am not able to blindly re-type all of the code anyway.
And this is great experience! <3

1. Simple sphere
2. Spheres on a plane
3. Basic shadows
4. Texturing: using vector products to calculate texture

#### useful resourses
[Scrathpixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com/index.php?redirect) is fantastic library!
They have great materials and specific images and docs! You should definately check them out.
